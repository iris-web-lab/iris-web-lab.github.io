# iris-web-lab.github.io

The code for the iRIS website.üëÅÔ∏è

This code is being deployed on Github pages! ü§©

If you want to use this yourself:üßë‚Äçüîß
1. Fork it and make the repository name start with your own username instead of "iris-web-lab" ( yourusername.github.io ).
2. Make a google sheet and set it to be accessable by anybody with link.
3. Make two sheets in that spreadsheet, one named products and one blog.
4. In all of the .html files replace any mention of "iRIS" with your own brand, replace logo.png with a transparent image of your own logo (name the file the same), and banner.jpeg with a (preferably) square, high quality jpeg of what you want to be the backround of the banner, also find links that look like this:
"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/109zQw4KjhYl4UneLxvPRLINLHriIw8MwtdGx8Bvk4LY/gviz/tq?tqx=out:json&sheet=products"
5. Replace the bunch of random letters and numbers after /d/ but before /gviz/ with the same bunch of leters and numbers you can find in the link to your spreadsheet.
6. You can't copy and paste the entire link. These links have special instructions at the end.
7. Make sure to fill out the spreadsheet like in this example: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q15iYfcVLFSmKTqjwgUbuAWdYMdW_tJKuOKlh1imGQs/
8. Once you've comitted all the changes go to the name of the repository as a link.

9. If something isn't working or you need support, contact iRIS at iris.group@engineer.com (that's an email).
